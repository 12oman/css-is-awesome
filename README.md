# css‑is‑awesome — lesson plan & README

A compact, opinionated, mana‑enhancing class using the classic ‘CSS is awesome’ energy to teach the cascade, specificity, layout, and dev‑tools fluency. Works in any modern browser. No frameworks.

---

## Why this lesson

CSS is simultaneously powerful and mischievous. We’ll lean into that: make tiny rules, observe big effects, and build intuition. The goal is flow, not perfection.

**You’ll leave able to:**

* read and reason about the cascade and specificity
* debug the box model with dev tools
* layout with Flexbox and Grid without copy‑pasting recipes
* create responsive, type‑safe, accessible components
* capture and explain tricky CSS behaviours with minimal examples

---

## Repo contents

* `index.html` – starter page with meme‑adjacent elements to style
* (optional to add) `styles.css` – split‑out stylesheet if you prefer

> Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or use a lightweight server (e.g., VS Code ‘Live Server’).

## Setup (5 mins)

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open in your editor. Turn on word wrap, install the HTML/CSS language features extension if needed.
3. Open DevTools (Right‑click → Inspect). Keep the **Elements**, **Styles**, **Computed**, and **Accessibility** panes visible.
